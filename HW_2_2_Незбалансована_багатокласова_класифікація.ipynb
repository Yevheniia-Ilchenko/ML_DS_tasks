        "Сегментація клієнтів – це практика поділу бази клієнтів на групи індивідів, які схожі між собою за певними критеріями, що мають значення для маркетингу, такими як вік, стать, інтереси та звички у витратах.\n",
        "\n",
        "Компанії, які використовують сегментацію клієнтів, виходять з того, що кожен клієнт є унікальним і що їхні маркетингові зусилля будуть більш ефективними, якщо вони орієнтуватимуться на конкретні, менші групи зі зверненнями, які ці споживачі вважатимуть доречними та які спонукатимуть їх до купівлі. Компанії також сподіваються отримати глибше розуміння уподобань та потреб своїх клієнтів з метою виявлення того, що кожен сегмент цінує найбільше, щоб точніше адаптувати маркетингові матеріали до цього сегменту.\n",

        "Автомобільна компанія планує вийти на нові ринки зі своїми існуючими продуктами (P1, P2, P3, P4 і P5). Після інтенсивного маркетингового дослідження вони дійшли висновку, що поведінка нового ринку схожа на їхній існуючий ринок.\n",
        "\n",
        "На своєму існуючому ринку команда з продажу класифікувала всіх клієнтів на 4 сегменти (A, B, C, D). Потім вони здійснювали сегментовані звернення та комунікацію з різними сегментами клієнтів. Ця стратегія працювала для них надзвичайно добре. Вони планують використати ту саму стратегію на нових ринках і визначили 2627 нових потенційних клієнтів.\n",
